Contribute
==========

When you work in a team or group of developers, you always need to share information about how to contribute to a
project.  
If you have only one project then it's usually easy. New developers will just have to spend some time to apprehend the
way you work. But when you have multiple projects, you can't afford to waste a huge amount of time to learn every single
projects. You need to specify a common way of doing things and share this to all your developers.

This repository tries to achieve this by giving some rules to follow when you want to create or contribute to a project.  
Every developers needs to be aware of this repository so every project must reference it in their README.md file.

Contributions and tools may vary depending on the language used. For instance, you can not use a coding style for both
ruby and JavaScript. So we split this guide according to the language the developer used:
